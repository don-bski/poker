### Poker
**OS: Linux and Windows**<br/>
**DrawPoker.pl** - Proof of concept perl based five card draw poker game. Linux only. CLI based ANSI color/character 
cards. Only basic game play is implemented and win/lose checking is incomplete.<br/>
**DrawPokerGUI.pl** - Improved version of five card draw poker using Perl-tk. Auto-selection of a fixed game 
table size based on screen resolution. Requires the perl GD module for image sizing. Yeah, perl-tk. Some 
challenges during developmnent but it works pretty good.<br/>
